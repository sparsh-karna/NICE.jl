# NICE
NICE is a package for determining solving simultaneous equilibria problems with networks of complex chemical reactions. The name comes because the main approach is [**N**et-event kinetic Monte Carlo](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135404002789), applied to fill in an **ICE** ([Initial, Charge, Equilibrium](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Equilibria/Le_Chateliers_Principle/Ice_Tables)) table.

The scope of `NICE` also supports direct solution of the nonlinear equations associated with simultaneous equilibria and (normal) kinetic Monte Carlo. While some innovations are present in the net-event kinetic Monte Carlo code, the intention of NICE is to support studies of relatively complicated but small systems: sophisticated parallelization techniques that would be needed to treat very large-scale problems are not included.
